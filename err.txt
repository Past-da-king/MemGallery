Memory Delete Feature
1. Hold-to-Select/Delete Mode

Long-press on a memory card to enter selection mode.
Multiple cards can be selected at once.
Multiple selection behavior:

If more than one card is selected, only full memory deletion is allowed.
Prompt confirms: “Are you sure you want to delete these memories permanently?”



2. Single Memory Selection

User taps on a single memory/card to open options.
Delete Media Option:

Pop-up asks which media to delete: image, audio, or both.
Only media uploaded via the app can be deleted; user-uploaded images are preserved.
Deleting media does not remove text/transcription.


Post-delete UI behavior:

If all media is deleted, user is asked: “Do you want to hide this memory?”
Hidden memories remain in the database but are no longer displayed in the UI.
Text/transcriptions remain intact.



3. Full Memory Deletion (Single or Multiple)

Single memory: user can choose “Delete Full Memory” to remove everything.
Multiple memories: full deletion is automatically applied.
Confirmation prompt: “Are you sure you want to permanently delete this memory?”
Effect: memory is fully removed from the database and UI.

4. UI & Feedback

Deletions update the UI immediately.
Clear prompts differentiate between deleting media vs full memory to prevent accidental loss.
Options are intuitive: Delete Media, Delete Full Memory, Hide Memory.


This way, users can:

Remove media without losing the memory or transcription.
Fully delete one or multiple memories permanently.
Hide memories if desired while preserving text.
