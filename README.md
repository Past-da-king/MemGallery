## 🤔 Why MemGallery?

### The Problem
We encounter hundreds of pieces of information daily—screenshots, conversations, articles, reminders. Traditional galleries and note apps treat these as disconnected files. Finding that one specific screenshot or link from last week is often a hassle.

### The Solution
MemGallery transforms your Android device into an intelligent memory system that:

1. **Never Forgets**: Automatically captures screenshots and organizes web links
2. **Understands Context**: AI reads and comprehends the content of your images and audio
3. **Makes Everything Searchable**: Find anything using natural language
4. **Extracts Actionable Items**: Automatically detects events and adds them to your task list
5. **Works Offline-First**: Your data stays on your device until you choose to process it
